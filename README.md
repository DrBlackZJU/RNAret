## Introduction

RNAret is a user-friendly tool designed for the prediction of RNA-RNA interactions. It empip install pipreqsploys advanced algorithms to analyze and identify potential interactions between different RNA molecules, which can be crucial for understanding various biological processes. This tool is particularly useful for researchers in molecular biology and bioinformatics who are interested in studying RNA interactions.

## Installation

To start using RNAret, you need to clone the repository from GitHub and install the required dependencies. Please ensure you have Git and Python installed on your system before proceeding.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the RNAret repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DrBlackZJU/RNAret.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the RNAret directory:
   ```
   cd RNAret
   ```
4. Install the dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

RNAret provides a simple and intuitive interface for predicting RNA-RNA interactions. Below are examples of how to use the main scripts included in the package.

### Example 1: Basic Interaction Prediction

To predict interactions between two RNA sequences, you can use the `predict_interaction.py` script.

```python
python predict_interaction.py --sequence1 "AGUCGA" --sequence2 "CGAUCG"
```

This command will output the predicted interaction sites between the two RNA sequences.

### Example 2: Batch Processing

If you have multiple RNA sequences and want to predict interactions in batch, you can use the `batch_prediction.py` script. This script accepts a file containing RNA sequences in FASTA format.

```python
python batch_prediction.py --input_file "sequences.fasta"
```

The script will generate a report detailing the interaction predictions for each pair of sequences in the input file.

### Example 3: Visualization of Interactions

To visualize the interactions, RNAret includes a `visualize_interaction.py` script that generates graphical representations of the predicted interaction sites.

```python
python visualize_interaction.py --sequence1 "AGUCGA" --sequence2 "CGAUCG" --output_file "interaction.pdf"
```

This command will create a PDF file named `interaction.pdf` in the current directory, showing the interaction sites between the two RNA sequences.
